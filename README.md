## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Some ideas to improve the app:
- Enhance the UI by using custom fonts and adding styled text for labels.
- Add an option to randomize text color in addition to background color.
- Integrate additional UI elements such as sliders or a color picker for more user control over colors.

## Notes

### Challenges Encountered:
- Adjusting the button style and placement to make the UI visually appealing on all device sizes.
- Learning to use the Assistant Editor to connect UI elements with the logic in the ViewController.
- Understanding Swift functions and type conversions, especially with `CGFloat` and `UIColor` for generating random colors.

### Key Takeaways:
- Gained hands-on experience with Xcode and Storyboard-based UI design.
- Practiced connecting UI elements to logic using `@IBAction` and writing Swift functions.
- Developed foundational skills in debugging and testing an iOS app.
